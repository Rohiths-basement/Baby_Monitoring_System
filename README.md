# Baby_Monitoring_System
This is a Baby Monitoring System built with the help of Arduino UNO in order to explore the concepts taught as part of the course, **"Microprocessor &amp; Computer Architecture: (UE20CS252)" **

Picture of the model has been uploaded to this same repository.

Make the Connections as specified in the code 
**OR**
Modify the code according to the connections made.

The Project is designed with a baby's crib in mind, it is going to be attached to the crib and thus will monitor the baby during when they sleep in the night or take rest throught the day.
The Project need not be limited only to a crib, it can be added to any other place such as the baby's trolley, car seat etc.



**Sensors Used: (and their application)**
1) Temperature Sensor: If the Surrounding Temperature (environmental temp.) is greater than a certain threshold (30 Celsius in our case because of the summer heat), then the buzzer starts beeping so surrounding people get notified and can then take the baby to more suitable conditions.
2) Smoke Sensor: If there is any sort of unnecessary/harmful smoke present in the environment, this detects it and makes the buzzer beep so that people nearby get alerted and can thus move the baby to more habitable conditions.
3) Pulse Sensor: If the baby's pulse exceeds a certain limit, then it may be indicative of either the baby being sick or some sort of danger and thus, it would be best for parents to check up on the baby, which they can do after this system would alert them in the form of the buzzer buzzzing.
4) Ultrasonic Sensor: This sensor is used to check if the baby is still in it's place where it is supposed to be (like in the crib, trolley or car-seat). If someone picks up the baby, then this sensor detects the space being empty and thus would alert the family.


**NOTE:** 
All the above-mentioned beeps of the buzzer have a different tune and delay each, hence making it easy for the family/ surrounding people to distingiush all of the 4 types of alarms/ sounds.
After the baby's safety is ensured, the buzzer sounds can be stopped with just the press of a button.




**Future Plans/Possible Modifications:** 
The base system can be built upon and improved in order to add a system of sending notifications/alerts to the concerned authority's phone via bluetooth or wifi, so that all alerts can be accumulated in one place and can be viewed later if necessary.
Could add other sensors like the rain sensor to check if it's raining in the trolley.
